# Overview
This repository contains implementation of LDGCNN model ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10014)) 
using Pytorch and PyTorch Geometric.
# Testing
You can test model on ShapeNet using ```test_ldgcnn_shapenet.py``` on your local machine. In case you want to use Google Colab, here is the [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oediDoQXfdtFZCZORyyF0bmAU7nUFfLL?usp=sharing) for a notebook in which you can run this script.
